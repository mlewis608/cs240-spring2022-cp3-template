# Create your own makefile by copying from others, or writing one from scratch
#
# For CP3, you may put all of your code into one .cpp file and skip building
# the .o file if you want to.  That would lead to a very simple CP3 makefile!
#
# You may also use the Parser I gave you for CP2
#
# The targets I used for mine are below:
#
#madness: madness.cpp Parser.h
#	g++ -Wall -Wextra madness.cpp -o bin/madness
#
#clean:
#	rm bin/madness
